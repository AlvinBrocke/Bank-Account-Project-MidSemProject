### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (such as g++)
- Command-line interface

### Compilation
1. Download the source file (BankAccount.cpp) to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files (`main.cpp`).
4. Run the following command to compile the program:
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o bank_accounts
    ```
    This command compiles the source code (`main.cpp`) and generates an executable named `bank_accounts`.

2. The program will execute, displaying information about the bank accounts stored in the system.

### Program Functionality
- The program creates instances of bank accounts, including savings and checking accounts, and adds them to a vector.
- It displays information about all bank accounts stored in the system.
- The program then performs various operations on the bank accounts, such as depositing money, withdrawing money, adding interest to savings accounts, and testing operator overloading for combining bank accounts.
- Finally, it displays the updated information about all bank accounts after the operations are performed.
